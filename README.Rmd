## Description 

The ChromR package brings some functions to help analysts, Ph.D. students and technicians to plan and organize LC analyses. The functions are separated into 2 main sections, Pre-analyse and Post-analyse. In Pre-analyse, the functions will help to randomize the injections order,  calculation of the quantity of mobile phase and the spent time of batches. The Post-analyse functions will help to organize the obtained files according to their respective batches or classes, avoiding human error.

## Getting Started

### a) Install package dependencies 

```R
install.packages(c("devtools","lubridate", "ggplot2", "progress"))

```

### b) Install the package

```R
install_github("ebruginski/ChromR")

```
## Overview

### Pre-analyse functions

<b>Sample Randomization:</b> 

x = The dataframe for this function need to have: first column as samples id and the second column as sample groups.

gnumber = number of groups in the sample, need to be between 2 and 6.

gnames = names of the groups, need to be the same of the input data frame.

<sub>Example:</sub>
```R
library(ChromR)

## Input the sample list

samplelist <- read.csv("/example/samplelist.csv")

## Run the randomization function

rsamplelist <- SampleRand(x = samplelist, gnumber = 2, gnames = c("disease", "health"))
```
<b>Mobile phase and time calculation:</b>


### Post-analyse functions
