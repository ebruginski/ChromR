Description
-----------

The ChromR package brings some functions to help analysts,
Ph.D. students and technicians to plan and organize LC analyses. The
functions are separated into 2 main sections, Pre-analyse and
Post-analyse. In Pre-analyse, the functions will help to randomize the
injections order, calculation of the quantity of mobile phase and the
spent time of batches. The Post-analyse functions will help to organize
the obtained files according to their respective batches or classes,
avoiding human error.
