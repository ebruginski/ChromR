#' ChromR package
#'
#' The ChromR package brings some functions to help analysts, Ph.D. students
#' and technicians to plan and organize LC analyses. The functions are separated into 2 main sections,
#' Pre-analysis and Post-analysis. In Pre-analyse, the functions will help to randomize the injections
#' order,  calculation of the quantity of mobile phase and the spent time of batches.
#' The Post-analyse functions will help to organize the obtained files according to their respective
#' batches or classes, avoiding human error.
