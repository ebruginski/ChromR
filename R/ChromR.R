#' The ChromR package brings some functions to help analysts, Ph.D. students and technicians to plan and organize LC analyses.
#' The functions are separated into 2 main sections, Pre-analyse and Post-analyse. In Pre-analyse, the functions will help to randomize
#' the injections order,  calculation of the quantity of mobile phase and the spent time of batches.
#' The Post-analyse functions will help to organize the obtained files according to their respective batches or classes,
#' avoiding human error.
